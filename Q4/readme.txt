1) An attacker "192.168.202.96" made a root login request to
"192.168.25.152"s MySQL service but the acces was denied.  I was able
to find this attack attempt via filtering pcap file with different
protocols.

2) Attacker "192.168.202.115" tried to attack SMB server at IP
"192.168.24.100" by doing a brute force pattern search to "/Documents
and Settings" folder. This attack did not seem to be successfull. The
corresponding filtered .pcap of transactions between attacker and blue
team is present in /data/smb_attack_attempt.pcap

3) When I analyzed pcap file with snort there was an interesting
/var/log/snort/alert file generated which listed all the detected
CVEs.  Many of these CVEs description matched the earlier detected
CVEs in Q3. Almost all red teams and competitors detected by snort
matched the red_teams and competitors found in question 1

4) I further analyzed the alert file generated by snort with series of
grep, uniq, sort commands to get the freqency of CVEs used attackers,
frequncies of red_teams involved in attack and frequencies of
competitors involved in attack
