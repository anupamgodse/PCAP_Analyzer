Question1:

Identifying IP addresses of end hosts:
#identify all end hosts
tshark -r ../data/maccdc2012_00003.pcap -T fields -e ip.src "not icmp" | sort | uniq > ../data/end_hosts_ip.txt

Now we want to classify these IP addresses as "Red Team", "Competitors", "Service Requests" and "Unknown"

To do this I analyzed the PCAP file and found that few hosts are sending SYN requests to random ports and in return receiving "RST ACK" packets from the target.
Clearly this looks like an attack.
To identify the defendors and the attackers I filtered all packets having tcp flags set to "0x14" i.e the RST and ACK bits are set meaning that the host is resetting the connection (A probable technique to defend an attack or if a host is not listening on that port then it will send this or maybe a firewall will send this)

#IPs of defendors
tshark -r ../data/maccdc2012_00003.pcap -T fields -e ip.src "tcp.flags==0x14" | sort | uniq > ../data/Competitors.txt

#IPs of attackers
tshark -r ../data/maccdc2012_00003.pcap -T fields -e ip.dst "tcp.flags==0x14" | sort | uniq > ../data/RedTeam.txt

Firstly, I split pcap file into multiple 100000 packet files.

Scanning through single file revealed multiple protocols in use: ARP, BROWSER, CDP, CLASSICSTUN, DB-LSP-DISC, DHCP, DNS, EIGRP, HTTP, ICMP, ICP, LLMNR, LOOP, MDNS, MySQL, NBNS, NTP, PGSQL, RADIUS, RARP, RIPv1, SMB, SNMP, SRVLOC, SSDP, SSH, SSLv3, STP, TCP, TLSv1, UDP, XDMCP

Further I classified these protocols as used by hosts, routers and switches

Used by,
hosts: ARP, BROWSER, CDP, CLASSICSTUN, DB-LSP-DISC, DHCP, DNS, HTTP, ICMP, LLMNR, MDNS, MySQL, NBNS, NTP, PGSQL, RADIUS, RARP, RIPv1, SMB, SNMP, SRVLOC, SSDP, SSH, SSLv3, TCP, TLSv1, UDP, XDMCP

routers: ARP, CDP, DHCP, DNS, EIGRP, HTTP, ICMP, LLMNR, MDNS, RARP, RIPv1, SNMP, UDP

switches: CDP, LOOP, SNMP, STP 


Identifying all end hosts devices and communications between them:
#get unique connections
tshark -r ../data/maccdc2012_00003.pcap -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst "not icmp" | sort | uniq > ../data/connections.txt

Explanation: identify unique source and destination tuples which are no icmp packets. This will give all endhosts communications.

Identifying routers:
1) Using EIGRP protocol (Only CISCO routers)
2) Src address of packets having "icmp.type==9", These are router advertisement messages sent by routers
3) Src address of packets having "icmp.type==11 and icmp.code==0", these are ttl exceeded icmp error msgs sent by routers

Identifying switches:
1) src and dst MAC addresses of packets having protocol field as STP, this is a spanninng tree protocol run by switches
2) src and dst MAC addresses of packets having protocol field as LOOP, this is a protocol used by switches to detect loops
